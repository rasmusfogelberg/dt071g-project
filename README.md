# DT071G - Projectassignment
## ClickerGame

This is my assignment project for course DT071G - C# .NET. We were tasked with creating a application in the framework .NET MAUI. I decided to create a mobile game application for Android. The game is a clicker game where the player is clicking buttons to create Ore and Bars and sell them for Monies. The player can also buy Auto-Miners and Smelters to automate the clicking process.

To be able to use this repository the developer will need Visual Studio 2022 Preview with .NET MAUI installed.
